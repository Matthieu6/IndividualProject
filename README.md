# Semantic Image Compression

The following repository contains the code used to evaluate different open-source image captioning and image generation models obtained from HuggingFace. Additionally, a final semantic image compression scheme can be found, representing the final deliverable of this research.

## Usage

The folders named ImageCaptioning and ImageGeneration include all image captioning and image generation models used respectively. These models were taken from HuggingFace and modified in order to run as intended. Their original author is mentionned in the Individual Project Report. It is possible to run each file in order to test how each work.

The folder named Metrics contains all tests ran in order to investigate which image captioning and generation models are best for the semantic image compression scheme created. Modifications were done on these metrics model in order to run accordingly. Their original author is mentionned in the Individual Project Report.
